# IMU-Based-Camera-Stabilization-System-using-Arduino-and-LabVIEW
A real-time pan-tilt camera stabilization system built with LabVIEW, Arduino UNO, and an IMU sensor. LabVIEW handles both motion control and real-time data visualization, enabling smooth camera orientation based on sensor feedback.

## Features

- Real-time IMU-based camera orientation control
- Pan and tilt movement via LabVIEW commands
- Sensor feedback recorded and visualized in LabVIEW
- Serial communication with Arduino UNO for data and control

## Tools & Components

- LabVIEW (main control and visualization platform)
- Arduino UNO (data relay and servo interface)
- MPU6050 IMU Sensor
- 2x Servo Motors
- Custom-built camera stand

## System Workflow

1. IMU sensor captures real-time orientation data.
2. LabVIEW reads the data and controls the servo angles.
3. Camera mount is adjusted accordingly via Arduino.
4. Orientation feedback is recorded and displayed in LabVIEW.
